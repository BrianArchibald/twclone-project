# TwClone

This application was part of a take home challenge during the IMT interview process.  The goal was to produce a Twitter like application using Django.

The requirements were:

* Allow a user to create an account
* disallow anonymous users from doing anything except creating an account
* allow a user to add a new message
    * limit message characters to 140
    * If a message contains a url to an image, show the image on the page instead of the URL
    * Do not count characters that are part of a URL (for links or images)
* allow a user to edit an existing message (if they created it)
* allow a user to delete an existing message (if they created it)
* allow a user to view a list of all of their own messages
* allow a user to view a list of all of another user's messages
* allow a user to list all messages for all users
* allow a user to search for a message
* allow users to send private messages to each other
